- The **slides** folder is a 15-16 hours course on basic CS. The content inside **basic-website** goes with it.
- The content in **robocode** should be used to teach basic java and robocode to high school kids in sessions of 1, 2 or 4 hours.
- The content inside **basic-java** has never been taught. The material is meant to be used to assist kids to learn java while doing robocode or other activities.
- The material in **essentials** contains university level teaching material
